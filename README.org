** How to Use

Your web root directory must contain at the very least, a file called *404.html*. Tinyserve will crash if this file is not present. If there is no *index.html* to serve for a =GET /= request, Tinyserve will fall back to *404.html*.

There is an example HTML site included with this repo, copy it to your =~/.config/tinyserve= the default web root, and give it a try. The default address is [[http://localhost:8000][localhost:8000]].
