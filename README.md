# Tinyserve

Tinyserve is a simple multi-threaded web server written in Rust. It serves the directory **~/.config/tinyserve** and loads *index.html* automatically. It binds to the address [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). It can serve up to 8 requests at a time.

## How to Use

Copy the directory at **example home dir/config/tinyserve** to your home directory, with the path **~/.config/tinyserve**. This is your web root.

## Changes coming soon

Ability to set the web root and the listening port are coming soon.
